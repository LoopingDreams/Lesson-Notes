Of course! Here are the detailed notes for Week 0 of CS50P, structured according to the topics you listed from the official course notes.

## **Creating Code with Python & Functions**

Your journey into programming begins with **functions**. A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific action. You "call" a function by writing its name followed by parentheses `()`.

The first function you'll meet is `print()`. It's used to display output to the screen. The value you put inside the parentheses, like `"hello, world"`, is called an **argument**.

Python

```
# The string "hello, world" is the argument passed to the print function.
print("hello, world")
```

---

## **Bugs**

A **bug** is an error in your program. A common early bug is a `SyntaxError`, which means you've broken one of Python's grammar rules.

Python

```
# This will cause a SyntaxError because the closing quote is missing.
print("hello, world)
```

---

## **Improving Your First Python Program**

Static programs aren't very interesting. Let's make our code interactive by getting information from the user. We can do this with the `input()` function, which prompts the user for text and waits for them to respond.

Python

```
# The text inside input() is the prompt shown to the user.
input("What's your name? ")
print("hello, world")
```

When you run this, the program will first ask for your name and then print "hello, world". It doesn't _use_ your name yet, but it's a start!

---

## **Variables & Comments**

To store the data we get from `input()`, we need a **variable**. A variable is a named container for a value. We use the equals sign (`=`), the assignment operator, to store a value in a variable.

**Comments** are notes for humans that the computer ignores. In Python, a comment starts with a hash symbol (`#`). They're essential for explaining _why_ your code does what it does.

Python

```
# Ask the user for their name and store it in the 'name' variable.
# Variable names in Python are traditionally written in snake_case.
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Say hello to the user
print("hello,")
print(name)
```

---

## **Pseudocode**

Before writing complex code, it's helpful to write **pseudocode**. This is a plain-language description of the steps in your program. It's like a recipe or a to-do list that helps you plan your logic without worrying about exact syntax.

```
# Pseudocode for our program:
# 1. Ask user for their name
# 2. Save the user's name
# 3. Print a greeting to the user
```

---

## **Further Improving Your First Python Program**

We can combine strings, a process called **concatenation**, using the `+` operator. This lets us join our greeting and the user's name on a single line.

Python

```
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Concatenate "hello, " with the value stored in the name variable
print("hello, " + name)
```

---

## **Strings and Parameters**

A **string** (or `str`) is a sequence of characters, like text.

A more elegant way to print multiple items is to pass them as separate arguments to the `print()` function. `print()` will automatically put a space between them. The placeholder for an argument in a function's definition is called a **parameter**.

Python

```
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Here, "hello," and the variable 'name' are two separate arguments.
print("hello,", name)
```

---

## **A small problem with quotation marks**

If your string needs to contain a quote, you can either enclose the string with the _other_ type of quote or use a backslash (`\`) to **escape** the inner quote.

Python

```
# Using single quotes to enclose a string with double quotes
print('He said, "Hello!"')

# Using a backslash to escape the inner double quotes
print("She said, \"Hi!\"")
```

---

## **Formatting Strings (f-Strings)**

The best way to embed variables directly into strings is with **f-strings** (formatted strings). Simply prefix the string with an `f` and place your variables inside curly braces `{}`.

Python

```
name = input("What's your name? ")

# This f-string embeds the value of 'name' directly.
print(f"hello, {name}")
```

---

## **More on Strings**

Strings come with built-in functions called **methods**. You call them using dot notation (`variable.method()`). You can also **chain** methods together to perform multiple actions in one line.

- `str.strip()`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace.
    
- `str.title()`: Capitalizes the first letter of each word.
    

Python

```
# Chaining methods: input is received, whitespace is stripped,
# and then the result is title-cased.
name = input("What's your name? ").strip().title()

print(f"hello, {name}")
```

---

## **Integers or `int`**

An **integer** (`int`) is a whole number. Since `input()` always gives back a string, you must convert it to an `int` if you want to do math. This conversion is called **type casting**.

Python

```
# Cast the string from input() into an integer
x = int(input("What's x? "))
y = int(input("What's y? "))

# Now we can perform mathematical operations
print(x + y)
```

---

## **Readability Wins**

While you can nest functions like `print(int(input("x: ")) + int(input("y: ")))`, it can be hard to read. Writing clear, step-by-step code is often better than writing the most compact code possible. **Readability wins**.

---

## **Float Basics & More on Floats**

A **float** is a number with a decimal point. Just like with integers, you can cast strings to floats using the `float()` function.

The built-in `round()` function can be used to round a float to a specified number of decimal places. You can also format numbers directly inside f-strings.

Python

```
x = float(input("What's x? "))
y = float(input("What's y? "))

# Round the sum of x and y to two decimal places
z = round(x + y, 2)
print(z) # e.g., 6.91

# An f-string can format this for currency, adding comma separators
# and ensuring two decimal places.
print(f"${z:,.2f}") # e.g., $1,000.00
```

---

## **`def`**

To keep code organized and reusable, we can define our own functions using the `def` keyword. It's a convention to put the main logic of your program inside a function called `main`.

Python

```
def main():
    name = input("What's your name? ")
    # This is a call to our custom 'hello' function
    hello(name)

def hello(to):
    print(f"hello, {to}")

# This line starts the program by calling the main function
main()
```

---

## **Returning Values**

Functions can send data back to the code that called them using the `return` keyword. This is incredibly powerful because it allows you to get a result from a function and store it in a variable.

Python

```python
def main():
    x = int(input("What's x? "))
    # Call the square function and print the value it returns
    print("x squared is", square(x))

# This function takes a number 'n' as a parameter and returns its square
def square(n):
    return n * n

main()
```

---

## **Summing Up**

In Week 0, you've learned the absolute essentials of Python: using functions like `print()` and `input()`, storing data in variables, understanding data types (`str`, `int`, `float`), and organizing your code by defining your own functions with `def` and `return`. You now have the foundational tools to start building more complex programs. ðŸš€
